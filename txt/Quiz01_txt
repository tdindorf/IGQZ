<p>Here is how Moodle Quizzes work (in this course):
<ul>
<li>For each question you can <b>Check</b> your answer to see if it is correct. If 'correct': good, you scored a point! 
<li>If 'incorrect' - you lose 20% of the question's value (e.g. 0.2 of a 1 point question), so think twice before you hit <b>Check</b>! 
Still, you have 5 chances to answer a question correctly, and score at least some points...</li>
<li><b>Next</b> will save your answer (<u>without</u> checking it) and take you to the next page.  This way you can see any/all of the questions before you answer any one of them.</li>
<li>After the last question <b>Next</b> will take you to a list of all the questions and their status (checked or not; if ‘yes’, points scored).  
You can now <b>Return to attempt</b> and keep working on your answers, or <b>Submit all and finish</b> to finish the quiz, have your grade <u>recorded in the system</u>, and be given feedback, which includes being shown all the correct answers.</li>
</ul>

<i>Important: until you hit <b>Submit all and finish</b>, your grade for a Quiz is a ‘0’ (zero), even if you did use <b>Check</b>.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>You can <b>Re-attempt</b> a quiz any time you like to improve your result. Each time you do so, however, the questions will change, so <b>learn how to solve a problem</b> - memorizing answers is pointless. </p>
<p>Your aim should be to <b>consistently</b> achieve an overall score of least 90% on <b>repeated</b> retakes: even if you get over 90% on your first (or nth) attempt, take the quiz again and again until no question surprises you. </p>
<p>I expect to see you <b>logged on and testing yourself</b> (on this, or any quiz(es) of your choice) <b>for 20-40 min each and every week</b>, from now till the end of the course. </p>

<p>Have fun - your preparation, and revision, for the final exam starts here!</p>
